- You need to finish the whole course
    - You need to just decide what day you want to do the course each week
    - Decide when you want to do the assignments
- To be a really effective deep learning practitioner, you need to finish the whole course
- Try to build a complete one project
- On your deep learning journey you will face many obstacles, both technical and posed by people around you who don't believe you'll be successful
- There's one guaranteed way to fail, and that's to stop trying
- We've seen that the only consistent trait amongst every fast.ai student that's gone on to be a world-clas practitioner is that they are all very tenacious.
- Start to share your work and active member of the deep learning community
- `Watch lecture` -> `Run notebook and experiment` -> `Reproduce results` -> `Repeat with different dataset`
