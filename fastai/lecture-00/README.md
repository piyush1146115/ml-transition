- You need to finish the whole course
    - You need to just decide what day you want to do the course each week
    - Decide when you want to do the assignments
- To be a really effective deep learning practitioner, you need to finish the whole course
- Try to build a complete one project
- On your deep learning journey you will face many obstacles, both technical and posed by people around you who don't believe you'll be successful
- There's one guaranteed way to fail, and that's to stop trying
- We've seen that the only consistent trait amongst every fast.ai student that's gone on to be a world-clas practitioner is that they are all very tenacious.
- Start to share your work and active member of the deep learning community
- `Watch lecture` -> `Run notebook and experiment` -> `Reproduce results` -> `Repeat with different dataset`
- Go to fastai forum for sharing your work and meet with other people: https://forums.fast.ai/ 
- For best effects, use one cup of theory, one cup of practice. Rinse and repeat
- The best way to improve as a developer:  "You don't sharpen your skills with resources, books, or articles. You sharpen your skills with practice, If you want to get better, go do the thing"

    - Join a competition early
    - Read forums daily
    - Make small improvements every day
- The best approach is to learn how others have done it.
- A better approach is to meet people who can make or influence hiring decisions where they hang out. That is on the forums, on social media, at conferences, and meetups or through the text of your blog posts. There is only one name to this game and that is credibility.
